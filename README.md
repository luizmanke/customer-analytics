# Customer Analytics

Customer analytics is a process by which data from customer behavior is used to help make key business decisions via market segmentation and predictive analytics.

The goal of this project is to develop a model that predict customer behaviors and undestand the key features related to those behaviors.

[This notebook](https://github.com/luizmanke/customer-analytics/blob/master/main.ipynb) has a step by step analysis of the problem.
